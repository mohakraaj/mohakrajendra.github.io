  <p>I was sipping my vanilla latte in Tim Horton’s, a young charming fair girl came in.</p>

<p>I looked at her, confirmed that she was pretty and again I got lost in my thoughts sipping my viscous latte. I suddenly heard a voice ‘Do you mind if I sit here’ with thick British accent and she sat next to me.</p>

<p>The slim figure with British accent reminded me of Emma Watson. Influenced by the popular Emma Watson, my brain made presumptions about her. Let us call these assumptions as Prior.</p>

<p>Prior was that ‘she is very much of a humanitarian person.</p>

<p>At this point in my life (Quarter life crisis), I was really looking forward to meet someone more kind.</p>

<p>I was baffled in my mind on how to find out how true my belief about the girl was.</p>

<p>My prior distribution was something like this.
<img src="assets/Bayesian-figure-1.png" /> 
Figure 1: I was strongly confident (standard deviation =5) that she was 80% benign.</p>

<p>We started conversation on what I work on and so forth.</p>

<p><strong>She</strong>: I am finance accountant in a cancer NGO</p>

<p>This made my Prior stronger, well she seems to be more humanitarian.</p>

<p>Whatever she says is<strong> <em>data</em></strong>, which will help me to understand if she is really benign.</p>

<p><strong>She</strong>: Do you like your job?
<strong>Me</strong>: I love machine learning. We make computers talk. Isn’t that cool?</p>

<p>She laughed loudly.</p>

<p><strong>She: <em>Piss off</em></strong>. Are you high? <strong>Dude</strong> you cant make a computer talk and feel. That is why we call it “computers” not humans.</p>

<p>Perplexed by her ignorance, found myself in a weird spot. I wondered, if I can ever make her believe that I was not a lying ass.</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: I wish I were high. Yeah we are still figuring out how to do it.</p>

<p>Blah blah blah.</p>

<p>I bought vanilla latte for both of us. Yes, she was charming.</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: You should be really proud working for a NGO. I always wanted to work in a NGO.
<strong>She</strong>: Bullshit. I just care about how much I get paid. I have my problems.</p>

<p>May be she is just frustrated with her life. <em>May be</em> who knows.</p>

<p><img src="assets/Bayesian-figure-2.png" /></p>

<p>Figure 2: My confidence about she being a nice girl reduced. I concluded that she is 60 % benign, I had my doubts about the conclusion (so s.d almost doubled). There is still a decent chance that she is more than 80 % benign.</p>

<p><strong>She continued</strong>: Who cares about bunch of people, who will die in few months?</p>

<p>She seems not to give a fuck about others.</p>

<p><img src="assets/Bayesian-figure-3.png" /></p>

<p>Figure 3: Her ignorance about suffering people, reduced my confidence in her goodwill to 40%. That is 60% she is malignant.</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: What do you feel people should do when they realize that they are going to die soon?</p>

<p><strong>She</strong>: Who the fuck cares. I am not going to die anytime soon. I will think about being nice to dying people when I am there.</p>

<p><img src="assets/Bayesian-figure-4.png" /></p>

<p>Figure 4: Now I was pretty sure that she was a badass girl. I was strongly confident (s.d = 5) that she is 20 % benign. That is 80 % badass girl.</p>

<p>Blah blah blah</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: I have to meet someone. Have a great day</p>

<p><strong>She</strong>: Cheers!!</p>

<p>I left the coffee shop and the girl for good.</p>

<hr />
<p>Lets retrospect what happened in the coffee shop.</p>

<p><strong>Prior [Probability (benign)]</strong>: Assumption about the girl</p>

<p><strong>Data</strong>: Talking to her revealed information about her.</p>

<p>As we talked (gathered data), I was more clear how much benign was she.</p>

<p><strong>Likelihood (Probability(data/benign))</strong>: For every gathered information we measure likelihood distribution, what is the probability that it would be said by 100 % benign person and 99.99% benign and so on .</p>

<p><strong>Posterior [Probability (benign /data)]</strong>: My conclusions based on the data and prior.</p>

<p>What happened here is Bayesian analysis. This is how our brain works, we do Bayesian analysis every single day.
After gathering data we re evaluate our probabilities.</p>

<p><strong>P(benign/data)</strong> is equal to</p>

<p><strong>P(data/benign) * P (benign)/ P(data).</strong></p>

<p><em>Long story short, now you know how to do Bayesian analysis.</em></p>
