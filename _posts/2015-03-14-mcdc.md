Neither all girls are hot nor all hot girls are opportunist and definitely not all functions are integrable.

Two dichotomous questions simultaneously ran in my mind. Can I marry a hot girl without knowing if she is an opportunist? Can I do Bayesian analysis if functions are not integrable? 

Lets us dwell into each one by one.

Bayesian Analysis 

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/MCDC_Figure1.png" alt="Bayesian Formula">
 
If our variable is continuous 

P(Data) =   ∫ ( P(Data/theta) * P(theta) * delta(theta))  -------------------(1) 


To make our analysis using Bayesian statistics, we have to compute equation (1).

In most of the real life applications equation (1) is not integrable. 

Isn’t integration same as summing, cant I divide theta to infinitesimally small points, evaluate and sum them. 

For Christ’s sake <strong>NO</strong>. It becomes computationally impossible even when there are 10 parameters. Do you remember this is exactly why mathematicians invented something and called it as ‘Integration’.

Since our brilliant idea of Integrations fails, lets see what we can do. 

So we want to evaluate posterior distribution P(theta/Data), but we are having hard time computing P(Data). What if there was a way to approximate P(theta/Data). 


<strong><em>This is why we introduce you to ‘Monte Carlo Marco Chain’ (MCDC).</strong></em> 

Before I begin with MCDC, let me tell a story about shrewd politician called Metropolis.

Metropolis was a shrewd and smart ass politician, who ended up in a string on islands, which can only be reasoned as his misfortune.

 Figure 1: This is the island where Metropolis got stuck ☹ 

Metropolis desired to change his misfortune into a fortune, that is to rule the island. He wanted to find the Population distribution of the islands to make an efficient campaign.

Let P(islands) be the population distribution, which looks something like this
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/MCDC_Figure3.png" alt="Population distribution"> 
 
Lets number the island from left to right. Leftmost island starts with zero.

Proposed_island is the island where Metropolis wants to move from his current island. The only information he could get from the mayor on the island was P(proposed_island/current_island) 

Metropolis came up with an algorithm

	1. Randomly select an island. He flipped a coin. 

		a) If coin flips tails, he will move to island on the left (proposed_island= current_island-1). 
		b) If coin flips tails, he will move to island on the left (proposed_island= current_island+1)
	
	2. Now ask Mayor for P(proposed_island) /P(current_island). Lets call this pmove.

	3. If pmove is greater than 1
	   then 
			move to the proposed_island.
	   Else 
	   		spin a fair spinner marked from 0 to 1. 
	   		
	   		If spinner shows value less than pmove, 
	   			then he moves to proposed_island
	   		Else 
	   			he decides to stay.

<strong><em>pmove = 0.5 * min(P(proposed_island)/P(current_island),1)</strong></em>

He repeated the above steps for long long time. And then he claimed that his distribution of visits is equal to Population distribution of the islands. 

Guess what, he was perfectly right. Let’s believe this as fact, after all metropolis was a smart ass and he called this algorithm as Metropolis algorithm.

To get intuition on what metropolis did

Relative probability of transition exactly matches the relative population distribution. This should give us tinge of idea that the islands will be visited proportional to the Population distribution.
 
 
If you don’t believe politicians, you can read more about the proof from references. 

 
Key points from metropolis algorithm
 
We can evaluate the posterior distribution P(theta/D), if we just know

Then we know

Did you see the magic metropolis algorithm did? It calculated P(theta/D) without calculating P(D) (without integration). That means our functions need not be integrable. 

This whole method of approximating Posterior distribution by randomly generating values from it is called Monte Carlo Markov Chain.

There are many other sampling processes similar to MetroPolis. One such widely used efficient method is Gibbs sampling. 
Lets get back to my dichotomy 

Can I calculate posterior distribution without integration? Definitely yes.
Can I make my marriage work without knowing if the girl is opportunistic? Still no idea ☹
